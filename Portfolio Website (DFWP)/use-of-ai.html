    <h1>Use of AI in this Website</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I wanted to create a custom navigation bar instead of using one of the prebuilt Bootstrap modules. I first
            used w3schools to code the basic framework of the nav bar, to ensure it functioned properly. I then used AI,
            in this case ChatGPT, to help me animate the nav bar as I am not too familiar with Javascript. It explained
            to me how to do it step by step, helping me learn JS while improving my website.</li>
        <li>I used remove.bg to remove the background on the logo used on my homepage.</li>
        <li>I used ChatGPT to understand why the Bootstrap CSS file was overriding my custom CSS. This turned out to be
            a simple fix, rooted in CSS’ hierarchical system. I just needed to move some code above other code, and
            ChatGPT pointed it out to me when I didn’t notice.</li>
        <li>I used ChatGPT (as well as w3schools) to help me understand why using height: 5px; didn’t
            change the height of my "hr" tag.</li>
        <li>I used ChatGPT to understand why my button wasn’t working. It turns out this was because of a HTML issue I
            accidentally caused after copying the button from Bootstrap and improperly pasting it.</li>
        <li>I used ChatGPT to help me with my nav bar issues. As I custom made my nav bar, Bootstrap couldn’t make it
            responsive, and I struggled to do it, especially the Javascript. I followed its instructions and was able to
            make my nav bar fully responsive, so it becomes smaller for tablets and collapses into a hamburger menu when
            on mobile devices.</li>
    </ol>
