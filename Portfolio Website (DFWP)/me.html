                      <h1>Final Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this final reflection, I will discuss my experience with this assignment and the journey to its completion,
        from start (the introductory lecture for the module) to finish.
        I began this module with confidence, as I have a fair amount of previous experience with HTML especially but
        also CSS. I also have experience with web and UX design and so felt very comfortable going into the assignment.
    </p>
    <h2>Three Compositions</h2>
    <p>I often use Figma for UI/UX, but had never heard of it being used to create graphics before, and was surprised to
        find we would be doing this as part of this assignment. I found the learning curve was easy to climb, and
        quickly got the hang of it. I designed my three compositions so that one is filled (coloured in), one is
        outlined, and the last is greyscale. I had no specific inspirations for my work; I simply spontaneously created
        them after they popped into mind. I find this is often when I do my best work: I think of an idea and flow
        through the design process, iterating as I go, rather than having to spend time searching for inspiration
        switching back and forth from it to my work. I still consider inspiration to be very crucial to the overall
        design process, but I didn’t have any for these particular graphics.</p>
    <h2>The Website</h2>
    <p>I started off a bit too ambitious with the website. I slowly realised, as the deadline grew closer, that some
        things would have to be sacrificed, but I remained satisfied with the final piece. I used a colour theme that I
        have previously used as I think it works really well: bluish greys, oranges, and whites. I decided to build my
        website in “sections”: first the hero section, then the “Featured Work” section, third the contact form ,and
        finally the footer, and the same on the rest of the pages. This enabled me to focus on one thing at a time and
        smoothly move through the site as each section was created. While I have more experience with HTML than CSS, I
        found that CSS was quite easy, especially with the help from Bootstrap, w3schools, and occasionally AI. I used
        AI only when I was very stuck, and found it had mixed results: sometimes it was great but other times the fixes
        weren’t successful or it changed my design without being asked.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this assignment. My aim with this degree is to become a UI/UX, so this was a very
        good experience. I also like front-end web development and I know it’s important even for designers, so I found
        it great to learn more HTML/CSS and get used to them more. While I didn’t find it too difficult overall, I did
        get stuck while debugging a few times but I am improving at it and noticing errors I didn’t see before.</p>

                        <li>I wanted to create a custom navigation bar instead of using one of the prebuilt Bootstrap
                            modules. I first used w3schools to code the basic framework of the nav bar, to ensure it
                            functioned properly. I then used AI, in this case ChatGPT, to help me make the nav bar
                            animated. I then used the explanation to implement the animation myself.</li>
                        <li>I used remove.bg to remove the background on the logo used on my homepage.</li>
                        <li>I used ChatGPT to understand why the Bootstrap CSS file was overriding my custom CSS. This
                            turned out to be a simple fix, rooted in CSS’ hierarchical system.</li>
                        <li>I used ChatGPT (as well as w3schools) to help me understand why using height: 5px; didn’t
                            change the height of my "hr" tag.</li>
                        <li>I used ChatGPT to understand why my button wasn’t working. It turns out this was because of
                            a HTML issue I accidentally caused after copying the button from Bootstrap, without
                            realising it.</li>
